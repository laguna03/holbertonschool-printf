# Building Our Own Printf Function
A Holberton School Project

## Description:
In this project the focus was to recreate the functionality of the well use C function "printf" in our own way.

![carbon (2)](https://github.com/laguna03/holbertonschool-printf/assets/144173998/4057b28a-d8d3-4383-b364-da0c5dc7f5a0)

For this project we needed to understand various C concepts:
1. Conditional statements.
2. Loops.
3. Header files.
4. Writing to the standard output.
5. Pointers and derefrencing.
6. How to invoking functions.
7. Variatic functions.

## Caveats
Our printf function can accept the following specifiers:
1. %c - for a single character.
2. %s - for a string of characters.
3. %d - for a number positive or negative.
4. %i - for a number positive or negative.

At this moment any other specifier like %o or %x is not implemented.
